# Audio to Text Conversion using Whisper on Windows

This guide explains the steps to set up a **Python environment** on **Windows** for converting audio to text using **Whisper** and **FFmpeg**.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.x
- FFmpeg (for audio conversion)
- Whisper (for speech-to-text)

## Python Libraries:
- **torch** (Whisperâ€™s dependency)
- **openai-whisper** (for transcription)
- **argparse** (comes with Python by default)
- **subprocess** (for calling FFmpeg)

## Step 1: Install Python and verify

**Download Python** from the official website:  [Python Downloads](https://www.python.org/downloads/)  
Run the installer.  
Make sure to **check the box that says "Add Python to PATH"** before clicking **Install Now**.  

On **Command Prompt** run the following command. You should see the Python version.:  
```cmd
python --version
```

## Step 2: Setup and activate virtual environment

**Create a Virtual Environment**:
Navigate to your project directory (where you want to store your project).
```cmd
python -m venv audio_to_text
.\audio_to_text\Scripts\activate
```
You should see `(audio_to_text)` at the beginning of the command prompt indicating the virtual environment is active.

## Step 3: Install required libraries

**Install torch openai-whisper**:
With the virtual environment activated, run:
```cmd
pip install torch
pip install openai-whisper
```

## Step 4: Install FFmpeg  
Go to the FFmpeg official website to download it:  [FFmpeg Download](https://ffmpeg.org/download.html)  
Download the **Windows builds from Gyan**:  [FFmpeg Builds](https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/)  
Download the **Release build** zip file.  
Extract it (e.g., to `C:\ffmpeg`) and set environment PATH to FFmpeg's **bin** folder (e.g., `C:\ffmpeg\bin`).  

Verify FFmpeg Installation in a new command prompt
```cmd
ffmpeg -version
```

## Step 5: Create Your Python Script for Audio-to-Text

1. **Create a Python file** (`audio_to_text_Whisper.py`) in your project directory.
   
2. **Add the following Python script**:

```python
import whisper
import subprocess
import argparse
import os

ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS = (".mp3", ".mp4", ".wav", ".flac")

def transcribe_audio(audio_path):
    if not audio_path.lower().endswith(ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS):
        print("Error: Unsupported audio format. Use MP3, MP4, WAV, or FLAC.")
        return

    model = whisper.load_model("base")

    # Convert audio to WAV if not already in WAV format
    converted_audio = "converted_audio.wav"
    
    if not audio_path.lower().endswith(".wav"):
        try:
            subprocess.run(
                ["ffmpeg", "-i", audio_path, "-ar", "16000", "-ac", "1", "-y", converted_audio],
                check=True, stdout=subprocess.DEVNULL, stderr=subprocess.DEVNULL
            )
        except subprocess.CalledProcessError:
            print("Error: FFmpeg failed to process the audio file.")
            return
    else:
        converted_audio = audio_path

    result = model.transcribe(converted_audio)

    print("\nTranscribed Text: ", result["text"])

    with open("transcription.txt", "w", encoding="utf-8") as file:
        file.write(result["text"])

if __name__ == "__main__":
    parser = argparse.ArgumentParser(description="Convert audio to text using Whisper.")
    parser.add_argument("audio_file", type=str, help="Path to the input audio file")
    args = parser.parse_args()

    if not os.path.exists(args.audio_file):
        print("Error: File does not exist!")
    else:
        transcribe_audio(args.audio_file)


```

## Step 6: Test it
An input file "input.mp3" has been provided to test. 
```
python audio_to_text_whisper.py input.mp3
```

## Output
The output looks like this:  
Transcribed Text:   In recent times, scammers and hackers have been approaching ordinary citizens, falsely claiming to represent the comment agencies. To protect the public from failing prey to such fraud, it would be beneficial for the comment to include a QR code-based system. In this approach, each legitimate comment officer could be assigned a unique QR code. The general public would then be able to scan the code to verify whether the person is genuine, confirm the legitimacy of the reported issues, and validate the authenticity of any request or demand made. This QR code system would provide a quick and easy way for citizens to differentiate between real government officials and scammers, ensuring greater transparency and security for the public.
